## Hosting, services, and internal security

- All data is securely stored on [Aiven](https://aiven.io/), ensuring privacy and end-to-end security. Access to the data is protected, and only the owner (@sirramboia) has access to.

### Manually

Users have the option to request the deletion of their data at any time. To learn how to do this, check out [this section](/legal/terms-of-service#cancellation-and-data-management).
